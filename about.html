              My name is <strong>Kayla Grogan</strong>. I love to learn and
              explore—you'll often find me either down a deep internet rabbit
              hole or in a foreign country—but I particularly enjoy exploring
              and applying the worlds of software development and technical
              writing to build <i>useful, creative, and well-documented</i>
              applications.

            <h3>My Background</h3>
            <p>
              I'm currently based in
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee" target="_blank"
                >Milwaukee, WI, USA</a
              >, and I've lived in the area my entire life.
            </p>
            <p>
              From my school days up until today, I've always been known by
              family and friends as being interested in and curious about
              computers. I've spent countless hours throughout my life on the
              computer exploring and creating.
